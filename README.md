## Introduction

[Ockam](https://www.ockam.io) is a collection of tools to help you create more secure, trustworthy and interoperable systems of connected devices.

Current features include:

* Unique, globally resolvable and cryptographically provable identifiers for each entity (device, service, asset, etc.) in a system.
* Decentralized Key Management using Decentralized Identifiers (or DIDs) and Ockam Blockchain's Decentralized PKI.
* Cryptographically Signed/Encrypted data flow between entities using Verifiable Claims.

Based on the above foundational features were are working on adding:

* Secure mutually authenticated communication channels between entities.
* Cryptographically Signed/Encrypted bulk data exchange (for firmware, etc.)
* Automated metadata discovery (to discover service endpoints and other on-boarding configuration)

and more.

## Go Package

This repository includes a Golang package that can be used to build Go programs (device firmware or a backend service) that act as light nodes on the Ockam Blockchain Network.

With Go version `1.11+` installed, add the ockam Golang package to your project using `go get`:
```
go get github.com/ockam-network/ockam
```

## Ockam Blockchain Network

The Ockam Blockchain Network stores Entity Documents and Claims. The [network is tuned for IoT](https://medium.com/ockam/ockam-is-tuned-for-iot-c2f04cae019a), designed for high throughput, low latency, fast finality, efficiency for low power devices, and ease of use.

Ockam maintains a [TestNet](https://ockam.network/) to help you build and experiment with applications. The Ockam TestNet has no service level guarantees, may have intermittent availability, may be down for maintenance, and may be restarted at anytime.

If your application needs a production-ready network, please email the Ockam team at hello@ockam.io.

## Hello Ockam

Here is some simple Go code to connect with the Ockam TestNet:

```go
// create a lightweight local ockam node and give it a way to find peers on the ockam test network
ockamNode, err := node.New(node.PeerDiscoverer(http.Discoverer("test.ockam.network", 26657)))
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// ask the local node to find peers and sync with network state
err = ockamNode.Sync()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// print the id of the chain that the network is maintaining.
ockamChain := ockamNode.Chain()
fmt.Printf("Chain ID: %s\n", ockamChain.ID())
```

The above code is in the [example directory](example/01_hello_ockam.go); you may run it by calling:
```
go run -mod=vendor example/01_hello_ockam.go
```

## Register an Entity

<img width="900" alt="ockam register" src="document/diagram/register.jpeg">

In Ockam, things are modeled as entities. Each `Entity` has a [DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/) that
begins with `did:ockam:` and uses the `ockam` DID method.

An example Ockam DID looks like this: `did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5`

```go
// create a new ed25519 signer
signer, err := ed25519.New()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// create a new ockam entity to represent a temperature sensor
temperatureSensor, err := entity.New(
	entity.Attributes{
		"name":         "Temperature Sensor",
		"manufacturer": "Element 14",
		"model":        "Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+",
	},
	entity.Signer(signer),
)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// register the entity by creating a signed registration claim
registrationClaim, err := ockamChain.Register(temperatureSensor)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Printf("registrationClaim - %s\n", registrationClaim.ID())
```

The above code is in the [example directory](example/02_register_entity.go); you may run it by calling:
```
go run -mod=vendor example/02_register_entity.go
```

This generates a new `ed25519` signer, then creates a new entity and assigns it that signer. It also adds some
attributes to the entity (e.g., its manufacturer's name).

The code above, as part of the `Register` method, lastly generates an `EntityRegistrationClaim`.  This
[verifiable](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/) registration claim embeds the
[DID Document](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#dfn-did-document) that represents this newly-created entity.

The claim is cryptographically signed using the entity's signer and then submitted to the network.

An example `EntityRegistrationClaim` claim looks like this:

```
{
	"@context": [
		"https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
		"https://w3id.org/security/v1"
	],
	"id": "did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5/claim/1brpf2pkh6",
	"type": [
		"EntityRegistrationClaim"
	],
	"issuer": "did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5",
	"issued": "2019-01-10",
	"claim": {
		"authentication": [
			{
				"publicKey": "did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5#key-1",

			}
		],
		"id": "did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5",
		"manufacturer": "Element 14",
		"model": "Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+",
		"name": "Temperature Sensor",
		"publicKey": [
			{
				"id": "did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5#key-1",
				"publicKeyHex": "3c93f446990ecd3ce64bcf9a5f949423d2e348948ee3aeb1c78924490f6b50f9",

			}
		],
		"registrationClaim": "did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5/claim/1brpf2pkh6"
	},
	"signatures": [
		{
			"created": "2019-01-10T07:53:25Z",
			"creator": "did:ockam:2QyqWz4xWB5o4Pr9G9fcZjXTE2ej5#key-1",

			"type": "Ed25519Signature2018"
		}
	]
}
```

## Submit a Claim

<img width="900" alt="ockam register" src="document/diagram/claim.jpeg">

Once an entity is registered, it can make signed, verifiable claims about itself or other entities.

This will create and submit a new signed claim that includes a temperature reading:
```go
// create a temperature claim with this new sensor entity as both the issuer and the subject of the claim
temperatureClaim, err := claim.New(
	claim.Data{"temperature": 100},
	claim.Issuer(temperatureSensor),
	claim.Subject(temperatureSensor),
)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// submit the claim
err = ockamChain.Submit(temperatureClaim)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Printf("Submitted - " + temperatureClaim.ID())
```

The above code is in the [example directory](example/03_submit_claim.go); you may run it by calling:
```
go run -mod=vendor example/03_submit_claim.go
```

This generates a signed claim of the following form:

```
{
	"@context": [
		"https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
		"https://w3id.org/security/v1"
	],
	"id": "did:ockam:2PdDcphFfkW5eU1C1mFB1i9H8ZsgC/claim/iu5aczbwnt",
	"type": [
		""
	],
	"issuer": "did:ockam:2PdDcphFfkW5eU1C1mFB1i9H8ZsgC",
	"issued": "2019-01-10",
	"claim": {
		"id": "did:ockam:2PdDcphFfkW5eU1C1mFB1i9H8ZsgC",
		"temperature": 100
	},
	"signatures": [
		{
			"created": "2019-01-10T08:00:31Z",
			"creator": "did:ockam:2PdDcphFfkW5eU1C1mFB1i9H8ZsgC#key-1",
			"domain": "ockam",
			"nonce": "iu5aczbwnt",
			"signatureValue": "UpCPc/Z6bGwUXfgNgRFxpQU2kSt8HBoe8E94JyvlAKG1yBNBfqb4oUKdPZPHOQH37JtiIFap9eGS4qMBP35DDA==",
			"type": "Ed25519Signature2018"
		}
	]
}
```

## Authentication

:construction: *This feature is under construction.*

DID based authentication enables a device to establish a mutually authenticated channel of communication with a
service. This channel can be used to reliably deliver signed data, firmware and new configuration.

<img width="900" alt="ockam register" src="document/diagram/device-service-auth.jpeg">

DID based authentication also enables a device to establish a mutually authenticated channel with another device.

<img width="900" alt="ockam register" src="document/diagram/device-device-auth.jpeg">

## Command Line

The `ockam` command is a useful tool to interact with the Ockam Network. You can install it for your
operating system from our [release bundles](https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/releases).

If you are on Mac or Linux, you can also use this simple
[downloader script](godownloader-ockam.sh):

```
curl -L https://git.io/fhZgf | sh
```
This will download the binary to `./bin/ockam` in your current directory. It is self-contained, so you can copy it to
somewhere more convenient in your system path, for example:

```
cp ./bin/ockam /usr/local/bin/
```

Once the command is in your path, you can run:

```
ockam --version
```

Next you can run:
```
ockam register
```
which will generate a unique Ockam [decentralized identity](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-primer) for
your computer and register that identity on the Ockam TestNet.

Here's an example running on a Raspberry Pi:

## Building

If you have recent versions of Bash and Docker installed on your machine, you can build and run the Ockam binary from
source via:

```
./build && ./build install && ockam --version
```

A `Vagrantfile` is also provided if you wish to work within a Vagrant and Virtualbox environment.
