# SSH into your Mac at home

I hava a Mac Mini at home and I often want to SSH into it from my Macbook Pro when I'm traveling to a different city or I'm at a work meeting. I don't want to expose my Mac Mini or home network to the Intenet so I use the Portals for Mac app.

Enable Remote Login using SSH on your Mac.
