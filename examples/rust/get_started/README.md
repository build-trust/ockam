# Get started

This Rust project is a companion to the [Reference guide](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/nodes).
It shows, through progressive examples, how:

 - nodes and routing work
 - how different transports can be used
 - how to create secure channels
 - how credentials can be exchanged over secure channels
 - how access-based control policies can be set on resources
