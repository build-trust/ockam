# This hands-on example uses Ockam to create an end-to-end encrypted portal to postgres. We
# connect a nodejs app in one private kubernetes cluster with a postgres database in another
# private kubernetes cluster.
#
# The example uses docker and kind to create these kubernetes clusters.
#
# You can read a detailed walkthrough of this example at:
# https://docs.ockam.io/portals/databases/postgres/kubernetes

    # Run `ockam enroll`.
    #
    # The enroll command creates a new vault and generates a cryptographic identity with
    # private keys stored in that vault. It then guides you to sign in to Ockam Orchestrator.
    #
    # If this is your first time signing in, the Orchestrator creates a new dedicated project
    # for you. A project offers two services: a membership authority and a relay service.
    #
    # The enroll command then asks this project’s membership authority to sign and issue
    # a credential that attests that your identifier is a member of this project. Since your
    # account in Orchestrator is the creator and hence first administrator on this new project,
    # the membership authority issues this credential. The enroll command stores the
    # credential for later use and exits.

    # Create an enrollment ticket to enroll the identity used by an ockam node that will run
    # adjacent to the postgres server in bank_corp's network.
    #
    # The identity that enrolls with the generated ticket will be given a project membership
    # credential in which the project membership authority will cryptographically attest to the
    # specified attributes - postgres-outlet=true.
    #
    # The identity will also allowed to create a relay in the project at the address `postgres`.
