# This script is used as an entrypoint to a docker container built using ../ockam.dockerfile.

# Run `ockam project enroll ...`
#
# The `project enroll` command creates a new vault and generates a cryptographic identity with
# private keys stored in that vault.
#
# The enrollment ticket includes routes and identifiers for the project membership authority
# and the projectâ€™s node that offers the relay service.
#
# The enrollment ticket also includes an enrollment token. The project enroll command
# creates a secure channel with the project membership authority and presents this enrollment token.
# The authority enrolls presented identity and returns a project membership credential.
#
# The command, stores this credential for later use and exits.

#
# Create an access control policy that only allows project members that possesses a credential with
# attribute postgres-outlet="true" to connect to TCP Portal Inlets on this node.

# This makes the remote postgres available on localhost:15432
