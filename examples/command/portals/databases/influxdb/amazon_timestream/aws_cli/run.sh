# This hands-on example uses Ockam to create an end-to-end encrypted portal to InfluxDB. We public data using Line protocol in
# one Amazon VPC with a Amazon Timestream managed InfluxDB database in another Amazon VPC.
#
# The example uses AWS CLI to create these VPCs.

# You can read a detailed walkthrough of this example at:

    # Run `ockam enroll`.
    #
    # The enroll command creates a new vault and generates a cryptographic identity with private keys stored in that
    # vault. It then guides you to sign in to Ockam Orchestrator.
    #
    # If this is your first time signing in, the Orchestrator creates a new dedicated project for you. A project offers
    # two services: a membership authority and a relay service.
    #
    # The enroll command then asks this project’s membership authority to sign and issue a credential that attests that
    # your identifier is a member of this project. Since your account in Orchestrator is the creator and hence first
    # administrator on this new project, the membership authority issues this credential. The enroll command stores the
    # credential for later use and exits.

    # server in metrics_corp's network.

    # project membership authority will cryptographically attest to the specified attributes - influxdb-outlet=true.
