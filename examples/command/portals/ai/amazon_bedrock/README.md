# Amazon Bedrock

This hands-on example uses Ockam to create an end-to-end encrypted portal to an Amazon Bedrock API.

We connect a nodejs app in one virtual private network with an Amazon Bedrock API in another virtual private network.
The example uses the AWS CLI to create these virtual networks.
