# The `project enroll` command creates a new vault and generates a cryptographic identity with

# The enrollment ticket includes routes and identitifiers for the project membership authority
# and the projectâ€™s node that offers the relay service.

# The enrollment ticket also includes an enrollment token. The project enroll command
# creates a secure channel with the project membership authority and presents this enrollment token.
# The authority enrolls presented identity and returns a project membership credential.

# The command, stores this credential for later use and exits.
