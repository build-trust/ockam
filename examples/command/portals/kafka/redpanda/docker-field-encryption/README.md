# Redpanda

In this hands-on example we send end-to-end encrypted messages _through_ Redpanda.

[<mark style="color:blue;">Ockam</mark>](https://docs.ockam.io/) encrypts messages from a Producer to a specific
Consumer. Only that specific Consumer can decrypt these messages. This guarantees that your data cannot be observed or
tampered as it passes through Redpanda. Operators of Redpanda only see end-to-end encrypted data. Any compromise of an
operator's infrastructure cannot compromise your business data.

The example uses docker and docker compose to create virtual networks.
