# Redpanda

This hands-on example uses Ockam to send end-to-end encrypted messages to Redpanda.
We connect a Kafka producer and consumer in one virtual private network with a Redpanda
server in another virtual private network.

The example uses docker and docker compose to create these virtual networks.
