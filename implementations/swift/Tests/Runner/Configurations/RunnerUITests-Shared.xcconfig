// Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries
//
// Always embed the Swift standard libraries in the target's products, even if the target
// does not contain any Swift code.  For example, this should be enabled if the target is
// embedding other products which contain Swift, or if it is a test target which does not
// contain Swift but which is testing a product which does.  This setting only applies to
// wrapped products, not to standalone binary products.

ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES = YES



// Code Signing Style
//
// This setting specifies the method used to acquire and locate signing assets. Choose
// `Automatic` to let Xcode automatically create and update profiles, app IDs, and
// certificates. Choose `Manual` to create and update these yourself on the developer
// website.

CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic



// Development Team
//
// The team ID of a development team to use for signing certificates and provisioning
// profiles.

// Info.plist File
//
// The project-relative path to the property list file that contains the `Info.plist`
// information used by bundles. For details on information property list files, see
// [Information Property List
// Files](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/ConfigFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002091-CJBJIEDH)

// Runpath Search Paths
//
// This is a list of paths to be added to the `runpath` search path list for the image
// being created. At runtime, `dyld` uses the `runpath` when searching for dylibs whose
// load path begins with `@rpath/`. See [Dynamic Library Programming
// Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/000-Introduction/Introduction.html).

LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) @executable_path/Frameworks @loader_path/Frameworks



// Product Bundle Identifier
//
// A string that uniquely identifies the bundle. The string should be in reverse DNS
// format using only alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`), the dot (`.`), and
// the hyphen (`-`). This value is used as the `CFBundleIdentifier` in the `Info.plist`
// of the built bundle.

// Targeted Device Family
//
// The build system uses the selected device to set the correct value for the
// `UIDeviceFamily` key it adds to the target's `Info.plist` file. This also drives the
// --target-device flag to actool, which determines the idioms selected during catalog
// compilation for iOS platforms.
