//! In order to support a variety of cryptographically capable hardware we maintain loose coupling between
//! our protocols and how a specific building block is invoked in a specific hardware.
//! This is achieved using an abstract Vault trait.
//!
//! A concrete implementation of the Vault trait is called an Ockam Vault.
//! Over time, and with help from the Ockam open source community, we plan to add vaults for
//! several TEEs, TPMs, HSMs, and Secure Enclaves.
//!
//! This crate provides a software-only Vault implementation that can be used when no cryptographic
//! hardware is available. The primary Ockam crate uses this as the default Vault implementation.
//!
//! The main [Ockam][main-ockam-crate-link] has optional dependency on this crate.
