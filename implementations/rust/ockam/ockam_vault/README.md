Ockam is a library for building devices that communicate securely, privately
and trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

In order to support a variety of cryptographically capable hardware we maintain loose coupling between our protocols and how a specific building block is invoked in a specific hardware. This is achieved using an abstract Vault trait.

A concrete implementation of the Vault trait is called an Ockam Vault. Over time, and with help from the Ockam open source community, we plan to add vaults for several TEEs, TPMs, HSMs, and Secure Enclaves.

This crate provides a software-only Vault implementation that can be used when no cryptographic hardware is available. The primary Ockam crate uses this as the default Vault implementation.

The main [Ockam][main-ockam-crate-link] has optional dependency on this crate.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
ockam_vault = "0.49.0"
```

## Crate Features

The `ockam_vault` crate has a Cargo feature named `"std"` that is enabled by
default. In order to use this crate in a `no_std` context this feature can
disabled as follows

```
[dependencies]
ockam_vault = { version = "0.49.0" , default-features = false }
```

Please note that Cargo features are unioned across the entire dependency
graph of a project. If any other crate you depend on has not opted out of
`ockam_vault` default features, Cargo will build `ockam_vault` with the std
feature enabled whether or not your direct dependency on `ockam_vault`
has `default-features = false`.
