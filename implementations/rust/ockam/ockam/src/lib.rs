//! End-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated, secure communication.
//!
//! _[A hands-on guide ðŸ‘‰][e2ee-rust-guide]_.
//!
//! Data, within modern distributed applications, are rarely exchanged over a single point-to-point
//! transport connection. Application messages routinely flow over complex, multi-hop, multi-protocol
//! routes â€” _across data centers, through queues and caches, via gateways and brokers_ â€” before reaching
//! their end destination.
//!
//! Transport layer security protocols are unable to protect application messages because their protection
//! is constrained by the length and duration of the underlying transport connection.
//!
//! Ockam makes it simple for our applications to guarantee end-to-end integrity, authenticity,
//! and confidentiality of data. We no longer have to implicitly depend on the defenses of every machine
//! or application within the same, usually porous, network boundary. Our application's messages don't have
//! to be vulnerable at every point, along their journey, where a transport connection terminates.
//!
//! Instead, our application can have a strikingly smaller vulnerability surface and easily make
//! _granular authorization decisions about all incoming information and commands._
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * End-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated _secure channels_.
//! * Multi-hop, multi-transport, application layer routing.
//! * Key establishment, rotation, and revocation - _for fleets, at scale_.
//! * Lightweight, Concurrent, Stateful Workers that enable _simple APIs_.
//! * Attribute-based Access Control - credentials with _selective disclosure_.
//! * Add-ons for a variety of operating environments, transport protocols, and _cryptographic hardware_.
//!
//! ## Documentation
//!
//! Tutorials, examples and reference guides are available at [docs.ockam.io](https://docs.ockam.io).
