        // - There are more users who use the stable version of Rust than on a
        //   nightly build, so we care more what the error messages look like on
        //   that version.
        // - Stable is updated less frequently, and is hopefully aptly named, so
        //   this should let us avoid churn in cases where the `rustc` developers
        //   are iterating on some aspect of error messaging.
        // - Choosing stable avoids us needing contributors to install nightly rust
        //   if they need to rebuild the trybuild output files, which would be an
        //   unnecessarly contribution roadblock.
