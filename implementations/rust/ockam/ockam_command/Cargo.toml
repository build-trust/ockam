# You may be wondering "Why are the tests and docs disabled?". The long and
# short of it is: To avoid certain bugs in `rustdoc`, `cargo`, and other tools
# which have cases (even edge-cases) where they confuse the library (in
# `../ockam`) and the `ockam` binary (in `./src/bin/ockam.rs`). I won't
# enumerate them here, but an example: `rustdoc` will try to place the docs for
# both of these in the same path, without realizing it, which may result in one
# overwriting the other)
#
# Anyway a result, we disable them for the binary crate, which is just a single
# file (`src/bin/ockam.rs`) which contains a single function call into
# `ockam_command` itself. This way, while there are no tests/docs for the binary
# crate, it doesn't matter, since its just a shim for the `ockam_command` crate
# anyway (which does not have its tests/docs disabled)
