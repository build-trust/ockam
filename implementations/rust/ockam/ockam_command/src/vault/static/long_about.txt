A vault is a secure storage location for secret keys belonging to Ockam identities. Ockam Vaults safely store these secret keys in cryptographic hardware and cloud key management systems.

Vaults are designed to be used in a way that secret keys never have to leave a vault. There is a growing base of Ockam Vault implementations in the Ockam Github Repository that safely store secret keys in specific KMSs, HSMs, Secure Enclaves etc.
