In Ockam, a space is an infinitely scalable Ockam Node in the cloud that can be created, managed, and scaled by Ockam Orchestrator. Spaces offer services such as creating projects within a space, inviting teammates to it, or attaching payment subscriptions.

When you enroll in Ockam for the first time, a space is created for you to host your projects.
