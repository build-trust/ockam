Create a InfluxDB  Outlet that runs adjacent to a the InfluxDB server. The Outlet unwraps Ockam messages and delivers the http request to the server, after attaching authentication information to it.

You must specify the TCP address of the server, that your Outlet should send raw TCP traffic to. You can also name your Outlet by giving it an alias.

When you create a InfluxDB Outlet, on an Ockam node, running on your local machine, it makes the TCP server available from a worker address, to the corresponding TCP Inlet (see `ockam tcp-inlet`).
