Create a TCP Outlet that runs adjacent to a TCP server. The Outlet unwraps Ockam messages and delivers the raw TCP messages to the TCP server.

You must specify the TCP address of the server, that your Outlet should send raw TCP traffic to. You can also name your Outlet by giving it an alias.

When you create a TCP Outlet, on an Ockam node, running on your local machine, it makes the TCP server available from a worker address, to the corresponding TCP Inlet (see `ockam tcp-inlet`).
