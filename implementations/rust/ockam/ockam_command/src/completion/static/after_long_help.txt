The following steps outline how to build the Ockam completion file, where to store it, and what to expect from the process.

#### Build the Completion File

Start by ensuring you have a valid directory available to store the completion files, depending on your operating system and shell:

- For Bash: `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions`
- For Zsh: `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions`
- For Fish: `~/.config/fish/completions`

If the directory doesn't exist, create it using the following command, replacing `{dir}` with the appropriate path:

```sh
mkdir -p {dir}
```

Generate the completion file by executing the relevant command for your shell. The file name must match the specific name for each shell.

```sh
# Bash
$ ockam completion --shell bash > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ockam.bash

# Zsh
$ ockam completion --shell zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_ockam

# Fish
$ ockam completion --shell fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ockam.fish
```

#### Update Completion Cache

After generating the completion file, it may be necessary to update your shell's completion cache to activate the changes:

```sh
$ compinit
```

#### Expected Results

Upon successfully completing the steps outlined above:

- The completion file will be generated according to the specified shell format.
- The file will contain relevant completion definitions for Ockam commands and options.
- The completion file will be saved in the designated directory for your shell.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and integrated the Ockam completion file into your shell environment. As you type Ockam commands, you'll enjoy the convenience of auto-suggestions and completion.
