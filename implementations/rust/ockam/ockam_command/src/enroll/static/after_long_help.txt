```sh
$ ockam enroll
```

To create your own identity and enroll with it, run:

```sh
ockam identity create my_id
ockam enroll --identity my_id
```

#### Troubleshoot:

If you have problems with your enrollment, please run `ockam reset --yes && ockam enroll` to delete your local state and start again. You can also reach out to us on Discord to ask for help https://discord.ockam.io.
