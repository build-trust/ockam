System
- COLORFGBG: a `string` that defines the foreground and background colors of the terminal.
  If it's not set it has no effect in the Ockam CLI.

CLI Behavior
- NO_COLOR: a `boolean` that, if set, the colors will be stripped out from output messages.
  Otherwise, let the terminal decide.
- NO_INPUT: a `boolean` that, if set, the CLI won't ask the user for input.
  Otherwise, let the terminal decide based the terminal features (tty).
- OCKAM_DISABLE_UPGRADE_CHECK: a `boolean` that, if set, the CLI won't check for ockam upgrades.
- OCKAM_HOME: a `string` that sets the home directory. Defaults to `~/.ockam`.
- OCKAM_LOG: a `string` that defines the verbosity of the logs when the `--verbose` argument is not passed.
- OCKAM_LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB: an `integer` that defines the maximum size of a log file in MB.

Devs Usage

- OCKAM_CONTROLLER_ADDR: a `string` that overrides the default address of the controller.
- OCKAM_CONTROLLER_IDENTITY_ID: a `string` that overrides the default identifier of the controller.
