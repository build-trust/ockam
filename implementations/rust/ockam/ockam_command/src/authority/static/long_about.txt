An Ockam Authority node is an Ockam node running a limited set of services used by other nodes to:

- issue credentials
- create enrollment tokens
- accept enrollment tokens
- authenticate identities as project members

Those services are accessible by creating a secure channel over a TCP connection at `tcp-listener-address`.
