```sh
# Create two nodes blue and green
$ ockam node create blue
$ ockam node create green

# Create a relay to node blue at node green
$ ockam relay create blue --at /node/green --to /node/blue
/service/forward_to_blue

# Send a message to the uppercase service on blue via its relay on green
$ ockam message send hello --to /node/green/service/forward_to_blue/service/uppercase
```

This can be very useful in establishing communication between applications that cannot otherwise reach each other over the network.

For instance, we can use relays to create an end-to-end secure channel between two nodes that are behind private NATs:

```sh
# Create another node called yellow
$ ockam node create yellow

# Create an end-to-end secure channel between yellow and blue.
# This secure channel is created through blue's relay at green, and we can
# send end-to-end encrypted messages through it.
$ ockam secure-channel create --from /node/yellow --to /node/green/service/forward_to_blue/service/api \\
    | ockam message send hello --from /node/yellow --to -/service/uppercase
```

In this topology green acts as an encrypted relay between yellow and blue. Yellow and blue can be running in completely separate private networks. Green needs to be reachable from both yellow and blue and only sees encrypted traffic.
