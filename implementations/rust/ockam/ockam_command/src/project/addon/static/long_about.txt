Cloud addons are additional services that can be added to Ockam projects to provide additional functionality. For example, the Confluent Cloud add-on provides end-to-end encryption for data in motion through Kafka, the InfluxDB Cloud add-on automates token management for InfluxDB Cloud, and the Okta add-on allows enterprise employees to get Ockam credentials using their regular corporate login.
