Ockam is a library for building devices that communicate securely, privately
and trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

In order to support a variety of proving protocols, this crate implements the BLS signatures scheme which can be used as a building block for other more elaborate zero-knowledge capable signatures like short group signatures.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
signature_bls = "0.11.0"
```

## Crate Features

The `signature_bls` crate has a Cargo feature named `"alloc"` that is enabled by
default. In order to use this crate in a `no_std` context this feature can
disabled as follows

```
[dependencies]
signature_bls = { version = "0.11.0"          , default-features = false }
```

Please note that Cargo features are unioned across the entire dependency
graph of a project. If any other crate you depend on has not opted out of
`signature_bls` default features, Cargo will build `signature_bls` with the std
feature enabled whether or not your direct dependency on `signature_bls`
has `default-features = false`.
