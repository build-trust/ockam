Ockam is a library for building devices that communicate securely, privately
and trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

This crate provides the `#[node]` and `#[node_test]` attribute proc_macros. The `#[node]` macro transforms
an async input main function into a regular output main function that sets up
an ockam node and executes the body of the input function inside the node. The `#[node_test]` does the same
but for test functions.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
ockam_test_macros = "0.4.0"
```
