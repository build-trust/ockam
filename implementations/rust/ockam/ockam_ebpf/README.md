Ockam is a library for building devices that communicate securely, privately
and trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

This crate contains the eBPF part of Ockam Reliable TCP Portals.

### Build

```bash
cargo build-ebpf
```

Building eBPFs have roughly following requirements:
 - Linux
 - Rust nightly
 - Some dependencies to be installed

Because of that crate with the eBPF code is kept out of the workspace.
Example of a virtual machine to build it can be found in `ubuntu_x86.yaml`.

Using ockam with eBPFs requires:
 - Linux
 - root (CAP_BPF, CAP_NET_RAW)

Example of a virtual machine to run ockam with eBPF can be found in `ubuntu_arm.yaml`.

eBPF is a small architecture-independent object file that is small enough,
to include it in the repo.

The built eBPF object should be copied to `/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_ebpf/ockam_ebpf`,
from where it will be grabbed by `ockam_transport_tcp` crate.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
ockam_ebpf = "0.1.0"
```
