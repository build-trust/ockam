//! This crate contains the eBPF part of Ockam Reliable TCP Portals.
//!
//! ## Build
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo build-ebpf
//! ```
//!
//! Building eBPFs have roughly following requirements:
//!  - Linux
//!  - Rust nightly
//!  - Some dependencies to be installed
//! Because of that crate with the eBPF code is kept out of the workspace.
//! Example of a virtual machine to build it can be found in `ubuntu_x86.yaml`.
//!
//! Using ockam with eBPFs requires:
//!  - Linux
//!  - root (CAP_BPF)
//! Example of a virtual machine to run ockam with eBPF can be found in `ubuntu_arm.yaml`.
//!
//! eBPF is a small architecture-independent object file that is small enough,
//! to include it in the repo.
//!
//! The built eBPF object should be copied to `/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_ebpf/ockam_ebpf`,
//! from where it will be grabbed by `ockam_transport_tcp` crate.
