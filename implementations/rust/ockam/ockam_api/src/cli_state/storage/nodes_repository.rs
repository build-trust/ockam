/// This trait supports the storage of node data:
///
///  - a node has a unique name
///  - a node is always associated to an identifier
///  - a node can be associated to a (single) project
///  - when a node is running we can persist its process id and its TCP listener address
///  - one of the nodes is always set as the default node
///  - a node can be set as an authority node. The purpose of this flag is to be able to display
///    the node status without being able to start a TCP connection since the TCP listener might not be accessible
