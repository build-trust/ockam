/// The identities repository stores metadata about identities
/// which change history have been stored in the ChangeHistoryRepository.
///
/// It allows to:
///
///  - associate a user name to an identity
///  - set one (and one only) identity as the default identity
///  - associate a vault name to an identity so that we know where the identity private keys can be found
///
/// By default the get/delete functions use the identity name as a parameter.
/// When they use the identity identifier instead, this is indicated in the function name:
/// e.g. get_named_identity_by_identifier()
///
