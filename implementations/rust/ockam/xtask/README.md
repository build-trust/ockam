Ockam is a library for building devices that communicate securely, privately
and trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

This xtask is designed for targets that require custom scripts to be built.
Currently, its only purpose is to build `ockam_ebpf` eBPF object file.

### Build

```bash
cargo build-ebpf
```

Building eBPFs have roughly following requirements:
 - Linux
 - Rust nightly
 - Some dependencies to be installed

Because of that crate with the eBPF code is kept out of the workspace.
Example of a virtual machine to build it can be found in `ubuntu_x86.yaml`.

Using ockam with eBPFs requires:
 - Linux
 - root (CAP_BPF, CAP_NET_RAW)

Example of a virtual machine to run ockam with eBPF can be found in `ubuntu_arm.yaml`.

eBPF is a small architecture-independent object file that is small enough,
to include it in the repo.

The built eBPF object should be copied to `/implementations/rust/ockam/ockam_ebpf/ockam_ebpf`,
from where it will be grabbed by `ockam_transport_tcp` crate.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
xtask = "0.1.0"
```
