Ockam is a library for building devices that communicate securely, privately
and trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

This crate supports the domain of "identities", which is required to create secure channels:

 - the `identity` module describes an entity as a set of verified key changes and an identifier
   uniquely representing those changes

 - the `identities` module provides services to create, update, and import identities

 - the `credential` module describes sets of attributes describing a given identity and signed by
   another identity

 - the `credentials` module provides services to create, import and verify credentials

 - the `secure_channel` module describes the steps required to establish a secure channel
   between 2 identities

 - the `secure_channels` module provides services to create a secure channel between 2 identities

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
ockam_identity = "0.86.0"
```
