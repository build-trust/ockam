//! This crate supports the domain of "identities", which is required to create secure channels:
//!
//!  - the `identity` module describes an entity as a set of verified key changes and an identifier
//!    uniquely representing those changes
//!
//!  - the `identities` module provides services to create, update, and import identities
//!
//!  - the `credential` module describes sets of attributes describing a given identity and signed by
//!    another identity
//!
//!  - the `credentials` module provides services to create, import and verify credentials
//!
//!  - the `secure_channel` module describes the steps required to establish a secure channel
//!    between 2 identities
//!
//!  - the `secure_channels` module provides services to create a secure channel between 2 identities
