Ockam is a library for building devices that communicate securely, privately
and trustfully with cloud services and other devices.

In order to support a variety of cryptographically capable hardware we maintain loose coupling between our protocols and how a specific building block is invoked in a specific hardware. This is achieved using an abstract Vault trait.

The main [Ockam][main-ockam-crate-link] crate re-exports types defined in
this crate.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
ockam_vault_core = "0.25.0"
```

## Crate Features

The `ockam_vault_core` crate has a Cargo feature named `"std"` that is enabled by
default. In order to use this crate in a `no_std` context this feature can
disabled as follows

```
[dependencies]
ockam_vault_core = { version = "0.25.0"      , default-features = false }
```

Please note that Cargo features are unioned across the entire dependency
graph of a project. If any other crate you depend on has not opted out of
`ockam_vault_core` default features, Cargo will build `ockam_vault_core` with the std
feature enabled whether or not your direct dependency on `ockam_vault_core`
has `default-features = false`.
