      Elixir allows us to use `_` as a name for variables that are not meant to be
      used. But itâ€™s a common practice to give these variables meaningful names
      anyway (`_user` instead of `_`), but some people prefer to name them all anonymously (`_`).

      A single style should be present in the same codebase.
