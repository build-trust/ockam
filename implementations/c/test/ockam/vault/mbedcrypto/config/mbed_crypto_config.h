 * Uncomment this option to prevent the use of double-width division.
 *
 * Note that division for the native integer type is always required.
 * Furthermore, a 64-bit type is always required even on a 32-bit
 * platform, but it need not support multiplication or division. In some

/**
 * \def MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS
 *
 * This configuration option controls whether the library validates more of
 * the parameters passed to it.
 *
 * When this flag is not defined, the library only attempts to validate an
 * input parameter if: (1) they may come from the outside world (such as the
 * network, the filesystem, etc.) or (2) not validating them could result in
 * internal memory errors such as overflowing a buffer controlled by the
 * library. On the other hand, it doesn't attempt to validate parameters whose
 * values are fully controlled by the application (such as pointers).
 *
 * When this flag is defined, the library additionally attempts to validate
 * parameters that are fully controlled by the application, and should always
 * be valid if the application code is fully correct and trusted.
 *
 * For example, when a function accepts as input a pointer to a buffer that may
 * contain untrusted data, and its documentation mentions that this pointer
 * must not be NULL:
 * - The pointer is checked to be non-NULL only if this option is enabled.
 * - The content of the buffer is always validated.
 *
 * When this flag is defined, if a library function receives a parameter that
 * is invalid:
 * 1. The function will invoke the macro MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED().
 * 2. If MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() did not terminate the program, the function
 *   will immediately return. If the function returns an Mbed TLS error code,
 *   the error code in this case is MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_BAD_INPUT_DATA.
 *
 * When defining this flag, you also need to arrange a definition for
 * MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED(). You can do this by any of the following methods:
 * - By default, the library defines MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() to call a
 *   function mbedtls_param_failed(), but the library does not define this
 *   function. If you do not make any other arrangements, you must provide
 *   the function mbedtls_param_failed() in your application.
 *   See `platform_util.h` for its prototype.
 * - If you enable the macro #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT, then the
 *   library defines MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED(\c cond) to be `assert(cond)`.
 *   You can still supply an alternative definition of
 *   MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED(), which may call `assert`.
 * - If you define a macro MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() before including `config.h`
 *   or you uncomment the definition of MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() in `config.h`,
 *   the library will call the macro that you defined and will not supply
 *   its own version. Note that if MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() calls `assert`,
 *   you need to enable #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT so that library source
 *   files include `<assert.h>`.
 *
 * Uncomment to enable validation of application-controlled parameters.

 *
 * This partially replaces one function. The header file from mbed TLS is still

/**
 * \brief       This macro is invoked by the library when an invalid parameter
 *              is detected that is only checked with #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS
 *              (see the documentation of that option for context).
 *
 *              When you leave this undefined here, the library provides
 *              a default definition. If the macro #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT
 *              is defined, the default definition is `assert(cond)`,
 *              otherwise the default definition calls a function
 *              mbedtls_param_failed(). This function is declared in
 *              `platform_util.h` for the benefit of the library, but
 *              you need to define in your application.
 *
 *              When you define this here, this replaces the default
 *              definition in platform_util.h (which no longer declares the
 *              function mbedtls_param_failed()) and it is your responsibility
 *              to make sure this macro expands to something suitable (in
 *              particular, that all the necessary declarations are visible
 *              from within the library - you can ensure that by providing
 *              them in this file next to the macro definition).
 *              If you define this macro to call `assert`, also define
 *              #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT so that library source files
 *              include `<assert.h>`.
 *
 *              Note that you may define this macro to expand to nothing, in
 *              which case you don't have to worry about declarations or
 *              definitions. However, you will then be notified about invalid
 *              parameters only in non-void functions, and void function will
 *              just silently return early on invalid parameters, which
 *              partially negates the benefits of enabling
 *              #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS in the first place, so is discouraged.

/**
 * Uncomment the macro to let mbed TLS use your alternate implementation of

 *
 * mbedtls_platform_zeroize() is a widely used function across the library to
 * zero a block of memory. The implementation is expected to be secure in the
 * sense that it has been written to prevent the compiler from removing calls
 * to mbedtls_platform_zeroize() as part of redundant code elimination
 * optimizations. However, it is difficult to guarantee that calls to
 * mbedtls_platform_zeroize() will not be optimized by the compiler as older
 * versions of the C language standards do not provide a secure implementation
 * of memset(). Therefore, MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_ZEROIZE_ALT enables users to
 * configure their own implementation of mbedtls_platform_zeroize(), for
 * example by using directives specific to their compiler, features from newer
 * C standards (e.g using memset_s() in C11) or calling a secure memset() from

 * gmtime() will be guarded by the global mutex mbedtls_threading_gmtime_mutex
 * if MBEDTLS_THREADING_C is enabled. We recommend that calls from outside the
 * library are also guarded with this mutex to avoid race conditions. However,
