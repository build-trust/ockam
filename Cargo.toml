    # This trick (where we glob workspace members with `*/src/..` or
    # `*/examples/..` — the latter being used because not all of our examples
    # have `src` directories, but they all have `examples` directories) helps
    # avoid including some obvious non-code folders. For example: folders
    # containing only gitignored contents which are leftover from a branch
    # change are typical (note that this was the motivation).

    # In an ideal world, we'd have a better way to identify all rust crates, but
    # I'm not sure how — the only item that's guaranteed to be present in Rust
    # crates is `Cargo.toml`, and `cargo` is unwilling to fall for something
    # like `members = ["**/Cargo.toml/.."]`.
