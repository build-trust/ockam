This tool can be used to stress test a project and see how it behaves under heavy load.

It shares the same `OCKAM_HOME` of the `ockam` command, and you need to perform the
set up using the `ockam` command before using it.
A setup could be either an `ockam enroll` or a `ockam project import`.
Relays are created using the same code as `ockam` command but portals are created using
a simpler implementation which doesn't involve TCP sockets.

You can also use the `deploy` script in this directory to deploy the stress test to a remote machine.

```
Usage: stress-test <COMMAND>

Commands:
run       Run the stress test
validate  Validate the configuration file
generate  Generate sample configuration files
help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
-h, --help  Print help
```

To debug failures, you can use:

```
OCKAM_LOG=error stress-test run <config.toml> --log
```

Sample configuration:
```
peak_portals = 20
peak_relays = 10
ramp_up = 60
throughput = "1 mbits"
project = "/project/default"
```
