              Our commits should have the following structure.

                <type>(<scope>): <subject>
                <BLANK LINE>
                <body>
                <BLANK LINE>
                <footer>

              Common errors to avoid:
              1. The commit header <type>(<scope>): <subject> must be in lower case.
              2. Allowed type values are: build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, test.
              3. Allowed scope values are: c, elixir, typescript, rust.
              4. Use the chore type as a last resort, prefer a more meaningful type.
              5. Only feat, fix, refactor type commits are included in our changelog.

              The linting rules are defined in:
