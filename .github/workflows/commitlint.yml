              https://ockam.io/learn/how-to-guides/contributing/CONTRIBUTING#commit-messages

              Our commits should have the following structure.

                <type>(<scope>): <subject>
                <BLANK LINE>
                <body>
                <BLANK LINE>
                <footer>

              Common errors to avoid:
              1. The commit header <type>(<scope>): <subject> must be in lower case.
              2. Allowed type values are: build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, test
              3. Allowed scope values are: c, elixir, typescript, rust
              4. Use the chore type as a last resort, prefer a more meaningful type.

              The linting rules are defined in:
              https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/blob/develop/tools/commitlint/commitlint.config.js
